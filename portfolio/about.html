            <p>
              I was born in Ukraine in 2009 to my parents. I'm an only child but I was very close with one of my cousins since she lived close to me. I went to school there but had to move to the U.S. due to the war in 2022. I went to Dirksen Elementary school and now I study in Lane Tech. I'm a freshman and in alpha program. 
              I am fluent in Ukrainian and English. I'm also currently learning Spanish and Polish.

                <p class="card-text">I'm an only child and I have very close connections with my parents. Back in Ukraine, I grew up in a household with my parents and my grandma. My great grandma would also visit often to babysit me when I was young but she recently died. My cousin lived very close to me and she's only 2 years older, so we would spend a lot of time together on weekends since my parents worked a lot.  </p>

                <p class="card-text">I have made a lot of friends a long the way. Many of them, I've stopped talking to, for different reasons. Some of them I've kind of forgotten about. But some of them I still talk to and they continue being my best friends. However all of them had a big impact in shaping who I am today. At Lane Tech, I've made a lot of friends and I'm grateful for it since they help me on my journey in life.  </p>
